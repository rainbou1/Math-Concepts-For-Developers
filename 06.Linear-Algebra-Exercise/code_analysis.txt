Problem 4:

======================================================================================================
Can you please tell me what this code is doing : import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.transforms import Affine2D
import skimage.io
import timeit

cat_image_r, cat_image_g, cat_image_b = [cat_image[:, :, i] for i in range(3)]
f, (ax_r, ax_g, ax_b) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize = (10, 5))
ax_r.imshow(cat_image_r, cmap = "gray")
ax_r.set_title("Red channel")
ax_g.imshow(cat_image_g, cmap = "gray")
ax_g.set_title("Green channel")
ax_b.imshow(cat_image_b, cmap = "gray")
ax_b.set_title("Blue channel")
plt.setp([ax_r, ax_g, ax_b], xticks = [], yticks = []) # Remove axis ticks
plt.show()

This code seems to be loading an image of a cat, splitting it into its red, green, and blue channels, and then displaying each channel separately using matplotlib.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

import numpy as np: Imports the NumPy library, which is commonly used for numerical computing in Python, and aliases it as np.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Imports the pyplot module from the Matplotlib library, which is a plotting library for Python, and aliases it as plt.
from matplotlib.transforms import Affine2D: Imports the Affine2D class from the matplotlib.transforms module. This class is used for 2D affine transformations.
import skimage.io: Imports the io submodule from the scikit-image library, which is used for image processing tasks.
cat_image_r, cat_image_g, cat_image_b = [cat_image[:, :, i] for i in range(3)]: Splits the loaded cat image into its red, green, and blue channels using list comprehension. Each channel is assigned to separate variables (cat_image_r, cat_image_g, and cat_image_b).
f, (ax_r, ax_g, ax_b) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(10, 5)): Creates a figure (f) with three subplots (ax_r, ax_g, and ax_b) arranged horizontally. The size of the figure is set to 10 inches in width and 5 inches in height.
ax_r.imshow(cat_image_r, cmap="gray"): Displays the red channel of the cat image on the subplot ax_r using the imshow() function. The colormap used is grayscale ("gray").
ax_r.set_title("Red channel"): Sets the title of the subplot ax_r to "Red channel".
Similar operations are repeated for the green and blue channels (ax_g.imshow(cat_image_g, cmap="gray"), ax_b.imshow(cat_image_b, cmap="gray")) and their corresponding titles.
plt.setp([ax_r, ax_g, ax_b], xticks=[], yticks=[]): Removes the ticks from the x and y axes of all three subplots.
plt.show(): Displays the figure with the three subplots containing the red, green, and blue channels of the cat image.
